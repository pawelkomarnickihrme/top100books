## Develop locally

If you haven't already done so, clone your Github repository to your local machine.

### Configure Auth

Follow [this guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github) to set up an OAuth app with GitHub and configure Supabase to use it as an auth provider.

In your Supabase project, navigate to [auth > URL configuration](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/auth/url-configuration) and set your main production URL (e.g. https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app) as the site url.

Next, in your Vercel deployment settings, add a new **Production** environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and set it to the same URL. Make sure to deselect preview and development environments to make sure that preview branches and local development work correctly.

### Install dependencies

Ensure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Local development with Supabase

It's highly recommended to use a local Supabase instance for development and testing. We have provided a set of custom commands for this in `package.json`.

First, you will need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/). You should also copy or rename:

- `.env.local.example` -> `.env.local`
- `.env.example` -> `.env`

Next, run the following command to start a local Supabase instance and run the migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
pnpm supabase:start
```

The terminal output will provide you with URLs to access the different services within the Supabase stack. The Supabase Studio is where you can make changes to your local database instance.

Copy the value for the `service_role_key` and paste it as the value for the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your `.env.local` file.

You can print out these URLs at any time with the following command:

```bash
pnpm supabase:status
```

To link your local Supabase instance to your project, run the following command, navigate to the Supabase project you created above, and enter your database password.

```bash
pnpm supabase:link
```

If you need to reset your database password, head over to [your database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) and click "Reset database password", and this time copy it across to a password manager! ðŸ˜„

ðŸš§ Warning: This links our Local Development instance to the project we are using for `production`. Currently, it only has test records, but once it has customer data, we recommend using [Branching](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/branching) or manually creating a separate `preview` or `staging` environment, to ensure your customer's data is not used locally, and schema changes/migrations can be thoroughly tested before shipping to `production`.

Once you've linked your project, you can pull down any schema changes you made in your remote database with:

```bash
pnpm supabase:pull
```

You can seed your local database with any data you added in your remote database with:

```bash
pnpm supabase:generate-seed
pnpm supabase:reset
```

ðŸš§ Warning: this is seeding data from the `production` database. Currently, this only contains test data, but we recommend using [Branching](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/branching) or manually setting up a `preview` or `staging` environment once this contains real customer data.

You can make changes to the database schema in your local Supabase Studio and run the following command to generate TypeScript types to match your schema:

```bash
pnpm supabase:generate-types
```

You can also automatically generate a migration file with all the changes you've made to your local database schema with the following command:

```bash
pnpm supabase:generate-migration
```

And push those changes to your remote database with:

```bash
pnpm supabase:push
```

Remember to test your changes thoroughly in your `local` and `staging` or `preview` environments before deploying them to `production`!

### Use the Stripe CLI to test webhooks

Use the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to [login to your Stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#login-account):

```bash
pnpm stripe:login
```

This will print a URL to navigate to in your browser and provide access to your Stripe account.

Next, start local webhook forwarding:

```bash
pnpm stripe:listen
```

Running this Stripe command will print a webhook secret (such as, `whsec_***`) to the console. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to this value in your `.env.local` file. If you haven't already, you should also set `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in your `.env.local` file using the **test mode**(!) keys from your Stripe dashboard.

### Run the Next.js client

In a separate terminal, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Note that webhook forwarding and the development server must be running concurrently in two separate terminals for the application to work correctly.

Finally, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application rendered.

## Going live

### Archive testing products

Archive all test mode Stripe products before going live. Before creating your live mode products, make sure to follow the steps below to set up your live mode env vars and webhooks.

### Configure production environment variables

To run the project in live mode and process payments with Stripe, switch Stripe from "test mode" to "production mode." Your Stripe API keys will be different in production mode, and you will have to create a separate production mode webhook. Copy these values and paste them into Vercel, replacing the test mode values.
